# Covid_Management_System
My partner and I created a high-level database design to help 
Health Centers manage COVID vaccines. Generated SQL queries and stored 
procedures to form reports to draw meaningful information that the health center might need. 

~~~
The administration of a vaccine in Federally Qualified Health Centers, 
specifically the COVID vaccine, requires the careful execution of several activities, 
which challenge the coordination of distinct departments, such as the billing or administration. 
Therefore, the formulation of a "COVID Vaccination Management System" claims the rigorous analysis 
of those core activities, which following one another, form the so-called “Flow of System”.
